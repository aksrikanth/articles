  :title: "Rohit Sharma's True Colors"
  :snippet: "They say a man's true colors show in adversity. I think the batting collapse during the 5th ODI counts as adversity enough to analyze Rohit Sharma's effort. On the face of it, Rohit Sharma top scored and made nearly a third of the teams runs. He batted till the very end and was only stopped when he ran out of partners at the other end. Good show?"

  :snippet: "No, I'm not talking about the first test, even though I have some thoughts about that. I'm talking about the super six match in that forgotten world cup. The outcome of this match is going to go a long way in deciding who will probably meet England in the world cup final. New Zealand are the favourites to win this match on recent form, and India have a young and inexperienced team."

  :snippet: "I've just updated rails to the newly released 2.3.2, and deployed it using passenger (mod_rails) 2.1.2. However there was a problem with the routing of static files. I use static haml files to serve the static content on the site like my code and publications pages."

  :title: "Automating E-Book Builds"
  :snippet: "A number of sources including Project Gutenberg  and Google have started to digitize books that have gone out of copyright. Unfortunately, these sources either provide unformatted plain text or device specific, closed and often DRM encumbered formats. Everytime I moved to a different device or computer, I had to download all my e-books in the appropriate format. Worse, any cleanups and formatting I had done to my earlier copies was lost and I had to go through the same process again. Tired of this, I decided to create an automated build process to generate e-books in different formats."

  :snippet: "One of the perks of being back in San Francisco is that I get to leave home during the day and actually go to work. This also means that I'm now surrounded by co-workers. This leads to a quest to find something to do together, and the answer was simple - Rock Band 2."
